Included in this directory are two files: 

saving_data.js

& 

replaying_data.js

saving_data.js is a partial example of what's required to save serial data from
a device so that you can play it back later, without needing to be physically 
connected to that device for playback. The file is a non-working subset of the
code we use, and can be used as a guide for recording data from a serial device
of your own. 

replaying_data.js is a simple, working example for replaying some previously 
recorded, arbitrary serial data.
