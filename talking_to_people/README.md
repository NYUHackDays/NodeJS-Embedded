This project highlights how to use a number of tools to create a modern single page web app.

This app will 1) allow easy code-reuse between the server and the client tier as well as
2) simple realtime code calling between the tiers, making rest-style communication no
longer necessary.

To run the code, execute 'make start'. A browser can then be opened at http://localhost:8080
